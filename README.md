# Hey 👋

My name is Samuel Medeiros 🧑
I'm just a student, I intend to become a full stack developer in the future and I've been studying front-end technologies since I was 9 years old.💻

I love exploring and solving new challenges, studying in the mornings, especially on weekends and doing new projects.
